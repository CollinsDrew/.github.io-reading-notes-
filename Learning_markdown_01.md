#h1 What is **Markdown?**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application.
Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems.
There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.
Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor.
In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown doesnt work like that.
When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.
For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One).
Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.
1.Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
2.Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.
3.Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
4.Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. 
5.Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.
