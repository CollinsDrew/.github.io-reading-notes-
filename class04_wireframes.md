# Wireframes and design

 ***Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level.
 A wireframe is commonly used to layout content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys.
 Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.
