## Input/Output in JS

The process of communicating with the outside world is known as input/output or I/O. 
An input is data that a computer receives. An output is data that a computer sends.
Computers only work with digital information. Any input that a computer receives must be digitised.
The computer sits between the input and output devices. A computer program processes and digitises the input information.
The result is then sent to an output device such as a screen.
