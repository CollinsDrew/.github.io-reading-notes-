# Programming with ***JS***

## Control Flow

*Control flow* is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the 
structures that change the control flow, such as conditions and loops.
Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure
and how it affects order of execution.

## Functions

*Functions* are a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
A JavaScript function is defined with the ***function*** keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses ().
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

## Operators

*Operators* are a special symbol used to perform operations on **values** and **variables**
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| + | addition |
| - | subtraction |
| * | multip;ication |
| ** | Exponentiation |
| / | division |
| % | Modulus (Division Remainder) |
| ++ | Increment |
| -- | Decrement |
