## What is Growth Mindset?

**Growth Mindset** is the a growth mindset is an approach to life in which an individual believes that their talents, intelligence, and abilities can be developed further.
people with a growth mindset have a passion to lear and gain new skills.

How i remind myself to stay in a *growth mindset* is to 
1. see all opportunites as a chance to learn, not a chance to fail.
2. remember the word **yet**. instead of thinking that im not very good at something, i remember to add the word **yet** at the end of that sentence.
3. i value the process of learning and not just the end result.
