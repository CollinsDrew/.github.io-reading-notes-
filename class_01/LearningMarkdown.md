# Heading 

This is just a heading


## Heading level 2

This is for heading 2

As we add more ### we can get the headings done

We can use **bold text** for getting bold text

We learned that we can use *italicized text* format for doing the italicized stuff done

Its interesting to know that we can do the lists using the following format:

1. First list item 
2. Second list item
3. Third list item

Its also interseting to know that we can even use unordered lists by following the above rules:

- First list item
- Second list item
- Third list item

The most important of all is to get the links done which we can do using [title](https://www.example.com)

Also we can use images as links using ![alt text](image.jpg)
